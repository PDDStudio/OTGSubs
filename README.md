### UPDATE: Project Status

This project has not received any updates in the last years and has not been tested on never Susbtratum compatible ROMs.
I'll keep this project archived so it's still available to browse the code and see how it worked internally.

**Note:**

This project is still in **Alpha Stage** and might contain several rough edges that need to be fixed!
